* Problem with new experimental API
** there is an issue if user invokes multiple tasks in thread pool directly from one of the worker
   under current settings they are going to end up with same job key.

** Also, new_worker can't have same method invocation conventions because it accepts more parameters.

* Ideas
** Okay, use:
   cache[job_key] = result
   cache[job_key] =>
     will return the result. worker_name, worker_key shall be taken in to account.

** Write a Rails controller that returns following information:
   - For each BackgrounDRb server:
     - Workers running
     - Memory taken by them
     - Number of threads in thread pool
     - Number of Tasks in Queue
     - If any worker key
     - Perhaps a count of open file descriptors
     - Scheduled tasks and next turn
  - Overall memory taken by entire BackgrounDRb server.
