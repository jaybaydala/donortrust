h1. Using Cucumber with Java

This directory contains code to demonstrate how Cucumber can be used to develop Java code.
You need JRuby 1.1.3 or higher installed and JRuby's bin directory on your PATH.

h2. Installing required gems

jruby -S gem install aslakhellesoy-cucumber
jruby -S gem install diff-lcs

h2. Running the scenarios

Open a shell in this directory (java) and execute the following command:

<pre><code>
jruby -S rake features
</code></pre>

This will compile the java code and package it in a jar file, and then run Cucumber against
that code.

There is a deliberate error. See if you can fix it!
