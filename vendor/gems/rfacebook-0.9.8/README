============================== RELEASE NOTES ==============================

0.9.8:
	- split up the Gem (core library) and plugin (Rails extensions) - you will now have to update your Rails plugin separately from the Gem
	- better documentation in the core library
	- deprecated all the confusing is_valid/is_ready/is_activated/is_expired methods in favor of simply 'ready?' and 'expired?'
	- removed the plugin code from the gem...the Rails plugin is now much better-separated
	- moved unit tests that applied to the core into the Gem itself (rather than the plugin)
	- cleaned out some unnecessary code in controller_extensions
	- refactored signature checking so that it happens in the plugin rather than in the core lib
	- added ssh_port to tunnel configuration (if for some reason you dont use 22)
	- added 'log_out_of_facebook' method to force a user to log out (clears the fbsession data)
