1.4.0

 * Support content:encoded. Accessible via Entry#content.
 * Support categories. Accessible via Entry#categories.
 * Introduces a new parsing feature 'loose parsing'. Use :loose => true
   when parsing if the required output should retain extra data, rather
   than drop it in the interests of 'lowest common denomiator' normalization.
   Currently affects how categories works. See the documentation in
   FeedNormalizer#parse for more details.

   for 'safe' display inside a web browser. Can be used as a standalone library,
   or as part of the Feed object. See Feed.clean! for details about cleaning a
   Feed instance. Also see HtmlCleaner and its unit tests. Uses Hpricot.
 * Added Feed-diffing. Differences between two feeds can be displayed using
   Feed.diff. Works nicely with YAML for a readable diff.
