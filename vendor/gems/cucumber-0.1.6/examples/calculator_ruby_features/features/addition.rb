  As a math idiot 
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers| do

  Scenario "Add two numbers" do
    Given "I have entered 50 into the calculator"
    And "I have entered 70 into the calculator"
    When "I add"
    Then "the result should be 120 on the screen"
    And "the result class should be Float"
  end
  
  Table do |t|
    t   | "input_1" | "input_2" | "output" | "class"  | t
    # This is kind of dumb - but it illustrates how scenarios can be "generated" in code.
    10.times do |n|
      t | n         | n*2       | n*3      | Fixnum   | t
