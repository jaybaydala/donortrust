    # A mixin gathering the methods a workitem store participant needs.
    #
    # Two kinds of methods are involved here, the ones used by the engine
    # (its participant map) and the ones used by 'workflow clients'.
    # Thus consume() and cancel() are triggered by the engine, and
    # save() and forward() are at the disposal of 'workflow clients'.
    #
    # A 'workflow client' is supposed to use methods similar to hash methods
    # to retrieve workitems, like in

    # The simplest workitem store possible, gathers the workitem in a 
    # hash (this class is an extension of Hash).

    # Some examples :
    #
    #     engine.register_participant(:alice, OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
    #     engine.register_participant("bob", OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
    #
    #     hp = engine.register_participant(:charly, OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
    #     #...
    #     puts "there are currently #{hp.size} workitems for Charly"
    #
    #     hp = OpenWFE::HashParticipant.new
    #     engine.register_participant("debbie", hp)
    #

    #
    # Implementation of a store participant stores the workitems in
    # yaml file in a dedicated directory.
    #
    # It's quite easy to register a YamlParticipant :
    #
    #     yp = engine.register_participant(:alex, YamlParticipant)
    #
    #     puts yp.dirname
    #
    # should yield "./work/participants/alex/" (if the key :work_directory
    # in engine.application_context is unset)
    #

        include StoreParticipantMixin

        attr_accessor :dirname

        #
        # The constructor for YamlParticipant awaits a dirname and an
        # application_context.
