module OpenWFE

    #
    # Every expression in OpenWFEru accepts a 'tag' attribute. This tag
    # can later be referenced by an 'undo' or 'redo' expression.
    # Tags are active as soon as an expression is applied and they vanish
    # when the expression replies to its parent expression or is cancelled.
    #
    # Calling for the undo of a non-existent tag throws no error, the flow 
    # simply resumes.

    #             participant "alice"

    #         end
    #     end
    #
    # In this example, as soon as the participant charly is over, the sequence
    # 'side_job' gets undone (cancelled). If the sequence 'side_job' was
    # already over, the "undo" will have no effect.
