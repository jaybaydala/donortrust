# 'when' and 'wait'
#

module OpenWFE

    #
    # The 'when' expression will trigger a consequence when a condition
    # is met, like in
    #
    #     <when test="${variable:over} == true">
    #         <participant ref="toto" />
    #     </when>
    #
    # where the participant "toto" will receive a workitem when the (local)
    # variable "over" has the value true.
    #
    # This is also possible :
    #
    #     <when>
    #         <equals field-value="done" other-value="true" />
    #         <participant ref="toto" />
    #     </when>
    #
    # The 'when' expression by defaults, evaluates every 10 seconds its
    # condition clause.
    # A different frequency can be stated via the "frequency" attribute :
    #
    #     _when :test => "${completion_level} == 4", :frequency => "1s"
    #         participant "next_stage"
    #     end
    #
    # will check for the completion_level value every second. The scheduler 
    # itself is by default 'waking up' every 250 ms, so setting a frequency to 
    # something smaller than that value might prove useless.
    # (Note than in the Ruby process definition, the 'when' got escaped to
    # '_when' not to conflict with the 'when' keyword of the Ruby language).
    #
    # The when expression understands the 'timeout' attribute like the 
    # participant expression does. Thus
    #
    #     _when :test => "${cows} == 'do fly'", :timeout => "1y"
    #         participant "me"
    #     end
    #
    # will timeout after one year (participant "me" will not receive a 
    # workitem).
    #
