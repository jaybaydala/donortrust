    #
    # MailParticipant is a simplification of EmailNotificationParticipant.
    #
    # It's initialized in this way :
    #
    #     p = MailParticipant.new(
    #         :smtp_server => "mailhost.ourcompany.co.jp",
    #         :from_address => "bpms@our.ourcompany.co.jp",
    #         :template => "Dear ${f:name}, you've got mail")
    #
    # or
    #
    #     p = MailParticipant.new(
    #         :smtp_server => "mailhost.ourcompany.co.jp",
    #         :smtp_port => 25,
    #         :from_address => "bpms@our.ourcompany.co.jp"
    #     ) do |workitem|
    #         s = ""
    #         s << "Dear #{workitem.name},\n"
    #         s << "\n"
    #         s << "it's #{Time.new.to_s} and you've got mail"
    #         s
    #     end
    #
    # As with EmailNotificationParticipant, the "to" address for your email
    # is taken from the workitem's <tt>email_target</tt> field. So, to have 
    # the email sent to "foo@nowhere.com", set your workitem's
    # <tt>email_target</tt> field to "foo@nowhere.com" prior to feeding it
    # to the mail participant.
    #
    # Likewise, you can also override the :from_address value by setting the
    # workitems <tt>email_from</tt> field.
    #
    # When passing the mail template as a block, you have 
    # four possible arities :
    #     { |workitem| ... }
    #     { |participant_expression, workitem| ... }
    #     { |participant_expression, participant_instance, workitem| ... }
    #     { ... }
    #
    # The smtp server and host default to "127.0.0.1" / 25.
    #
