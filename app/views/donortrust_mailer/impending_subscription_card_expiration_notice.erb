Hello,

We noticed that the credit card we have in our system for your UPowered subscription is due to expire in <%= @subscription.expiry_month.to_s.rjust(2, '0') %>/<%= @subscription.expiry_year %>.

To keep your subscription uninterrupted, we would appreciate if you could update your card. Just visit this address and you'll be good to go.
<%= @edit_upowered_url %>

Thanks!
The UEnd Team
