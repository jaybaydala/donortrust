      <h2>Community Development</h2>
      <p>A bit of a catch all category but the premise is central to everything UEnd supports.  For Community Development is a process through which a community builds itself using local knowledge, wisdom and skills to get out of poverty sustainably.  It takes time and local connections and support, and humility on the part of the consultant as it is never about the west coming to save, it is a journey together by which both parties learn and grow and come away changed for the better.</p>

      <h2>Water and Sanitation</h2>
      <p>This is a big one&hellip; water, or the lack of clean water leads to so many illnesses impacting a parent&#x27;s capacity to work and the opportunity for children to go to school. Even personal safety is affected depending on how far one has to walk on a daily basis to get water. This category usually includes drilling wells, cleaning up and controlling access to water so it can be kept clean and free of livestock feces as well as the building of latrines to ensure safe water and environments, thus reducing disease.</p>

      <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
      <p>Perhaps slower to get outcomes but no less important for a woman in the developing world who will directly impact the lives of at least 5 people. If one woman is given more respect and opportunity then her impact is greater to all within her influence. There are many cultural matters that interplay with this area so sensitivity is required for the changes to be lasting. It can be as simple as using the latent talent and education of many women to improve the lives in the community instead of looking outside the community for a solution.</p>
