<p><%= @gift.name || @gift.email %> has sent you a Gift Card for <%= number_to_currency( @gift.amount ) %> and you have chosen to match it!</p>

<p>Now that you've opened and matched your gift, you have some options. You can:</p>
<div class="gift-options">
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to "Find a project to donate to", dt_projects_path %></li>
    <% if Project.unallocated_project %><li><%= link_to "Let Uend: figure it out", new_dt_investment_path(:unallocated_gift => 1) %></li><% end %>
    <% if Project.admin_project %><li><%= link_to "Donate it to UEnd's Operational budget", new_dt_investment_path(:admin_gift => 1) %></li><% end %>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="textsm">Note: if you choose to do nothing, your gift will expire 30 days after it was sent, which is just like choosing &quot;Let Uend: figure it out&quot;</div>
