    Our flagship initiative, the Millennium Villages, now operating in 79 villages across 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, takes a comprehensive approach to addressing extreme poverty. By combining the best scientific and local knowledge, Millennium Villages address all the major problems simultaneously -- hunger, disease, inadequate education, lack of safe drinking water, and absence of essential infrastructure -- to assist communities on their way to self-sustainable development. The project is already producing remarkable results. Read more about the Millennium Villages and how you can help here.
