Before running this migration, please run the following SQL to make sure that 
there are no dependencies on the States, Districts and Regions that are just 
about to be deleted, i.e. the results of each SQL query should be 0.

If dependencies are found in anything other than the projects or 
project_versions table, please reassign them using the bus_admin website.
