@about_us.content = %Q(<p>UEnd empowers you to give a new kind of gift—one that helps eradicate extreme poverty and changes the way we think about giving through the redirection of  a small portion of your gift spending.</p> \n<p>UEnd launched on Nov. 5, 2007 under the name ChristmasFuture. We changed our name but kept the same great mission on October 1, 2009. Our website makes it easy for people to refocus a portion of their gift-giving budget towards the eradication of extreme poverty. Gift-givers send an online gift card to friends and family. The gift recipient chooses from a database of poverty-eradication projects and then allocates their gift towards a project that interests them. This new way to give puts the power of change into everyone’s hands.</p> \n<p>UEnd is about change—fundamental, meaningful, planet-shifting change. We’re the bridge through which everyone can participate in eradicating poverty by leveraging the goodwill of a powerful, passionate group: You - you choose, you change the world - for good. Together we can end extreme poverty.</p> \n<h2>Our Mission</h2> \n<p>UEnd exists to inspire and empower North Americans to refocus a portion of their gift-giving budget towards strategic and sustainable projects in the developing world to help them eradicate poverty.</p> \n<h2>Our Vision</h2> \n<p>We want to create a legacy of change that will, in turn, renew the North American experience of giving (and receiving). We want to bring the poorest of the poor in on our reasons to celebrate.</p> \n<p>In communities of the developing world, projects related to health, education, economy, agriculture, infrastructure, gender, water and sanitation and community development will be funded - giving people opportunity to achieve economically sustainable lives and a real vision for their future. The gifts we give today play a fundamental role in creating opportunity; the opportunity to see the end of extreme poverty in our lifetime.</p> \n<h2>Our Mandate</h2> \n<p>We are driven to help improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. And in transforming the lives of the poor we transform the lives of North Americans also. One day at a time, and permanently.</p> \n<p>To create a giving opportunity and method for North Americans to help change the world. One gift at a time.</p> \n<h2>Values</h2> \n<p><strong>Trust</strong>: We conduct ourselves in a manner that earns and deserves the trust of our stakeholders.</p> \n<p><strong>Dignity</strong>: We recognize and respect the dignity of all. Towards this end UEnd embraces the  <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html" title="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">UN&#8217;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Integrity</strong>:  Our actions match with the words that precede them. We consistently adhere to the highest moral and professional standards.</p> \n<p><strong>Humility</strong>: We have an accurate view of ourselves - neither higher nor lower, and always showing respect to others. To us, humility is equity.</p> \n<p><strong>Accountability</strong>: We are fully responsible to our words and actions.</p> \n<p><strong>Diversity</strong>: We recognize and embrace the diversity of all of our stakeholders, regardless of race, religion, gender, age, culture, heritage, sexuality, and geography.</p>)

Page.create(:title => "Founder's Journey",  :parent_id => @about_us.id, :permalink => "founders-journey", :content => %Q(<p>UEnd was born out of my personal experience and desire. As I made my way through a typical North American life I got a job out of school, made some money, acquired some things like a house and a car. As I continued down this typical path I also started to travel. I found myself really drawn to developing nations&hellip;I sensed joy and community like nothing I had experienced in my homeland&hellip;yet I was supposed to be the lucky one because of how much wealth I had access to. I&rsquo;d return from my trips into the land of abundance and really experience the inequality of it all. I had a growing sense that I had drawn the line in my personal life too far towards &lsquo;want&rsquo; and sought to move it closer towards &lsquo;need&rsquo;. So as I made the changes in my own life I wondered how many other people were experiencing the same angst. I really sensed this inequality during the Christmas season in North America. As I spoke with more friends, family, and acquaintances I realized that there was a similar and growing dissatisfaction with the experience during the Christmas season in North America. It seemed so ironic that although we are attempting to express love during the Christmas season through the buying of gifts, we ended up feeling even more disconnected.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me that there is an incredible opportunity here! If we could point these 2 &lsquo;problems&rsquo; at each other they could cancel each other out. We could address the consumerism in North America and people dying unnecessarily in the developing world at the same time!</p>\n<p>Additionally it seemed like the time was right in history to attempt something like this. Desire to help existed in this land of abundance, as demonstrated by the response to the Tsunami in 2004, to Earthquakes in Pakistan in 2005, and Katrina in 2005. Information Technology is at a point that can assist to bridge the gap. Awareness of the issues is unavoidable &ndash; we all know what&rsquo;s happening in our world. The science of integrated development has hit a new level &ndash; correcting the previous errors in its ways. So many paths converging&hellip;it was time! It IS time!</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that UEnd is an original idea, It&rsquo;s not my idea. It&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s idea. I believe it&rsquo;s simply an expression or the realization of an idea that most of us have already here in North America. Generally I think that we all want to live in a world where everyone has &lsquo;enough&rsquo;&hellip;enough at least to live. Another was to express that concept is that we don&rsquo;t want to live in a world where a person dies because they don&rsquo;t have meal&hellip;or lack of a 30 cent medicine. And as with most ideas it just takes one person to stand up and say it out loud, then everyone else can join in. That is what is happening.</p>))
