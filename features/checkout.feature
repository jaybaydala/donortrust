Story: A User goes to Checkout and pay for their Cart

As a User
I want to checkout
So I can pay for the items in my Cart

Scenario 1: 

# Given any user:
# ---------------
# During Checkout:
# x should show line items (gifts, investments and deposits) for this transaction
# x should allow the user to edit each line item
# - should include option to login/signup to link the transaction with
# your account
# - should have the user put in credit card and contact information to
# checkout
# (we will integrate ActiveMerchant to simplify other ways of taking
# credit card)
# 
# Given a registered/logged in user:
# ---------------------------------
# During Checkout:
# - can choose to take part or all of the total out of their account
# (this account balance section should be fairly visible)
# - can use their credit card for the transaction
