# - Add matching gift text upon open 'Your friend gave you a gift to help end global poverty. "Double the impact by matching your friends gift"'

# - Payment Options - they need to pay the extra balance from their credit card
#   - this is all held in the session alone (no db modeling)
#   - Add text "Friend's gift amount     --> $100"
#              "DoubleDown Impact amount --> $100"
